## Best Practices

### Team Structure
1. **Keep teams small**: 3-7 developers for optimal communication
2. **Cross-functional**: Include frontend, backend, and testing skills
3. **Clear ownership**: Each team owns specific product areas
4. **Rotating responsibilities**: Share leadership and review duties

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Atomic tasks**: Keep tasks small and independently deployable
2. **Clear acceptance criteria**: Every task has defined completion criteria
3. **Regular retrospectives**: Weekly team improvement discussions
4. **Continuous learning**: Encourage skill development and knowledge sharing

### Communication Guidelines
1. **Async-first**: Design workflows for distributed teams
2. **Status transparency**: Make progress visible to entire team
3. **Escalation paths**: Clear procedures for handling blockers
4. **Documentation culture**: Document decisions and tribal knowledge

## Error Handling

Common issues and their resolutions:

**Team member not found**: Verify GitHub username and organization access
**Permission denied**: Check GitHub token scopes and repository permissions
**Rate limit exceeded**: Implement exponential backoff and request queuing
**Webhook delivery failed**: Verify tunnel configuration and endpoint accessibility
